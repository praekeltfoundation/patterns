Paged Result Set
================

The paged result set allows an end-user to page through a set of results
that is larger than the communication channel is able to display fully.

Code

The state that implements this pattern is called the PaginatedChoiceState_
and is documented at the `Go JSBox documentation`_.

Implementations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   `RTS Zambia`_ uses a paged result set to allow an end user to page
    through a list of districts.
-   Switchboard_ uses a paged result set to allow a community health worker
    to select a cadre from a long list of cadres.
-   mAgriculture_ used a paged result set to allow a farmer to select
    crops from a long list of known crops.
-   NewsWorld_ uses a paged result set to display a list of news headlines.

Notes
~~~~~

-   the PaginatedChoiceState_ is a variation of the ChoiceState_ but
    adds the ability to page through a larger set.
