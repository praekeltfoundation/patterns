Card Stack
==========

A card stack allows an end-user to read small bits of content in chunks.
The content can be dynamically loaded from an external API. The end-user
can navigate between them using next, previous & exit controls.

The state that implements this pattern is called the BookletState_ and
is documented at the `Go JSBox documentation`_.


Implementations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   `Girl Hub Rwanda`_ uses a card stack to display content over
    USSD which is loaded from a Django based TastyPie API.
-   `Wikipedia Text`_ uses a card stack to allow a user to retrieve chunks
    of a Wikipedia article's content via SMS.


Notes
~~~~~

-   For USSD there is generally a maximum window of 30 seconds within
    which the content needs to be displayed, read and be responded to
    before a timeout is reached.
-   There is no limit on how many pages a Card Stack can contain.
    If this uses a session based transport like USSD the limits are all
    determined by the total session length that the mobile network
    operator imposes. In South Africa this is 3 minutes but this varies
    per country.
