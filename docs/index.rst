Welcome to Praekelt Patterns's documentation!
=============================================

Naming things is hard, naming things consistently is ever more hard.
The goal of this patterns repository is to help all stake holders in a
project to know and understand what we call the individual parts that
together make up the things we build.

Patterns described in this repository should:

1. Have a short name.
2. Have a paragraph (with or without illustration) describing
   the pattern. The paragraph should be suitable for non-technical
   people to understand and re-use when describing possible solutions
   to client problems.
3. A link to a sample implementation of the pattern. The sample
   implementation should have tests and be ready for a developer
   to look at understand and apply.

.. note::

    You are free to contribute to this repository, it is automatically
    published from changes made in the the GitHub
    `patterns repository <https://github.com/praekelt/patterns/>`_.
